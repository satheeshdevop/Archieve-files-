Archiving Files and Directories with Compression

ABOUT THIS LAB
	Creating a compressed archive file can be useful for backup purposes. In this hands-on lab, we're going to make a compressed archive of a directory containing a custom application before upgrading the application to guarantee that we have a copy of the working program.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
	Create an Archive Directory in the cloud_user Home Directory
	2. Make the Archive Directory the Current Directory
	3. Archive the /opt/myapp Directory as myapp.tar.gz
	4. List the Contents of myapp.tar.gz and Redirect It to app.list


Step1:	Create a archive file 
#  mkdir archive  

Step2:	Go to the directory
#  cd archive 
 
Step3:	Make archive (myapp.tar.gz) file in opt/myapp 
 #  tar -cvzf myapp.tar.gz /opt/myapp

Step4:	Redirect the contents from myapp.tar.gz to  app.list
#  tar -tvf myapp.tar.gz > app.list
